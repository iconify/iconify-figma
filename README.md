# Iconify plug-in for Figma

Import Material Design Icons, FontAwesome, Jam Icons, EmojiOne, Twitter Emoji and many other icons (more than 50 icon sets containing over 40,000 icons) to Figma document as vector shapes.

## What is Iconify?

Iconify is new unified icons framework. It is designed to replace outdated glyph fonts with modern JavaScript SVG framework
and offer massive choice of icons. Unlike fonts, Iconify only loads icons used on pages, so you can use icons from FontAwesome,
Material Design Icons, Firefox Emoji and more on web page without loading many fonts. It is fast and very easy to use.

See [https://iconify.design/](https://iconify.design/) for details.

In addition to script, Iconify is available as React component, Angular component and soon will be available as Vue component.

See [https://github.com/iconify/iconify-react](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-react) and [https://github.com/iconify/iconify-angular](https://github.com/iconify/iconify-angular)

## What can Figma plug-in do?

Figma plug-in offers easy way to import icons to project.

You can browse and search icon sets directly from Figma. No need to copy/paste icons - plug-in will import icons you select.

In future plug-in will be able to publish icons directly to Iconify, so it would take only 1 simple step from designing icon to using it on website. However that is a long term goal that requires massive amount of development, so hopefully it will be implemented by the end of 2019.

## Installation

In Figma on dashboard select "Plugins", "Browse all plugins", search for "Iconify". Click "Install".

## Usage

In Figma select main menu -> Plugins -> Iconify

Browse or search icons, select any icon, click "Import" button or drag icon to Figma document. Plug-in will import icon to your current project.

## Drag and drop

Due to Figma plug-in system limitations, drag and drop is approximate.
Figma does not support drag and drop from plugin UI, so plugin approximates drop location from mouse events, which is not precise.

Because of that icon might be dropped few pixels off target. To maximize chances of dropping icon to correct location, zoom in to correct frame or use "Import" button instead of drag and drop.

## Paste SVG

Paste SVG function can extract SVG from data URI (you can keep "url" part), such as

```
url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg fill='none' height='128' viewBox='0 0 32 128' width='32' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cg clip-rule='evenodd' fill-rule='evenodd'%3E%3Cpath d='m12 12v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23000' fill-opacity='.8'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 44v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23000' fill-opacity='.3'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 76v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%2318a0fb'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 108v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.209-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.657-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23fff'/%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E")
```

making it easy to paste background images from browser's developer tools.

# Development version

To install plug-in from repository you need to build it.

First build plugin using `npm run build`, then open Figma, in menu select Plugins -> Development -> New Plugin. Click "Link existing plugin", navigate to manifest.json

Build modes:

- `npm run build` - build production code. Output is stored in "dist".
- `npm run dev` - build development code. Output is stored in "dist". Change debug stuff in ui/plugin-ui.js (see conditional statements that check process.env.SEARCH_DEV).
- `npm run watch` - same as "dev", but also watches files for changes and automatically rebuilds files.
- `npm run start` - debug UI without Figma. Creates web server on http://localhost:8080/ and shows UI. Change UI configuration in ui/dev-ui.js
- `npm run test` - test Icon Finder core.

# Custom builds

To create custom build you need to change plug-in hash and name in manifest.json. This is enough for Figma to treat plug-in as separate plug-in, so it won't share configuration with Iconify plug-in.

This plug-in can be limited to one collection, making it easy to create custom plug-ins for collections. To set collection, add parameter "prefix" in ui/plugin-ui.js and ui/dev-ui.js. Code is already there, you only need to uncomment it and set to correct values.

You can disable any menu sections that you do not need in ui/src/components/header/navigation.jsx. Just comment out what you do not need. In About/GitHub menu please keep information about Iconify project and author. You can add your own information about your icon set as well.
