# Iconify plug-in for Figma

Import Material Design Icons, FontAwesome, Jam Icons, EmojiOne, Twitter Emoji and many other icons (more than 100 icon sets containing over 100,000 icons) to Figma document as vector shapes.

## What is Iconify?

Iconify is a new unified icons framework. It is designed to replace outdated glyph fonts with modern JavaScript SVG framework
and offer a massive choice of icons. Unlike fonts, Iconify only loads icons used on pages, so you can use icons from FontAwesome,
Material Design Icons, Firefox Emoji and more on a web page without loading many fonts. It is fast and very easy to use.

See [https://iconify.design/](https://iconify.design/) for details.

In addition to SVG framework script, Iconify is available as React, Vue and Svelte components.

See [Iconify icon components documentation](http://docs.iconify.design/icon-components/).

## What can Figma plug-in do?

Figma plug-in offers an easy way to import icons to a project.

You can browse and search icon sets directly from Figma. No need to copy/paste icons - plug-in will import icons you select.

In the future, Figma plug-in will be able to publish icons directly to Iconify, so it would take only 1 simple step from designing an icon to using it on a website. However that is a long term goal that requires a massive amount of development, so hopefully, it will be implemented by the end of 2019.

## Installation

In Figma on dashboard select "Plugins", "Browse all plugins", search for "Iconify". Click "Install".

## Usage

In Figma select main menu -> Plugins -> Iconify

Browse or search icons, select any icon, click the "Import" button or drag icon to Figma document. Plug-in will import icon to your current project.

## Drag and drop

Due to Figma plug-in system limitations, drag and drop is approximate.
Figma does not support drag and drop from plugin UI, so plugin approximates drop location from mouse events, which is not precise.

Because of that icon might be dropped a few pixels off target. To maximize chances of dropping icon to correct location, zoom in to correct frame or use the "Import" button instead of drag and drop.

## Paste SVG

Paste SVG function can extract SVG from data URI (you can keep "url" part), such as

```
url("data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg fill='none' height='128' viewBox='0 0 32 128' width='32' xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cg clip-rule='evenodd' fill-rule='evenodd'%3E%3Cpath d='m12 12v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23000' fill-opacity='.8'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 44v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23000' fill-opacity='.3'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 76v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.2091-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.6569-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%2318a0fb'/%3E%3Cpath d='m12 108v8h8v-1h-3c0-2.209-1.7909-4-4-4v-3zm1 4v3h3c0-1.657-1.3431-3-3-3z' fill='%23fff'/%3E%3C/g%3E%3C/svg%3E")
```

making it easy to paste background images from the browser's developer tools.
